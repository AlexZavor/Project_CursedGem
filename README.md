This is mostly just a log file for this project.
I am working on building a customizable text editor for simple work.
I decided eventually to work in Ruby using the curses library.

there are two projects under development. the cursed gem writing editor, and the cursed gem game, just for practice.

this is all a work in progress. as well, I have never worked with Ruby or curses before. so call me an amature if you must.

# Attempts:
	-python - failure to find compatible system
	-c++ - failure to install curses
	-Ruby - success
## Codename - Cursed Gem

#  Plans:
	Learn Ruby
	Learn curses
	Design menu
	writing:
		tab between code and format
		Shortcuts
			ctrl+D - duplicate
			ctrl+F - find
			ctrl+XCV - cut/copy/paste
			ctrl+Z - undo
		spellcheck
		formatting, markup language
	Export to PDF?
